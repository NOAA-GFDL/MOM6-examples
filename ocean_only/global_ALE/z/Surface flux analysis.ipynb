    "1. Maps of surface boundary fluxes of water, heat, and salt crossing into the liquid seawater in MOM6;\n",
    "2. Computation of self-consistency checks, including global heat, salt, and mass budgets to verify that the model is conserving scalars over the global domain.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Caveats regarding this notebook:\n",
    "1. This notebook is written for the MOM6-examples/ocean_only/global_ALE/z and \n",
    "   MOM6-examples/ocean_only/global_ALE/layer test cases.  \n",
    "   It is nearly the same as the notebook for MOM6-examples/ice_ocean_SIS/GOLD_SIS.\n",
    "2. It only considers tendencies over one day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hopes for the use of this notebook: \n",
    "1. To provide a starting point to document boundary fluxes of scalar fields;\n",
    "2. To teach MOM6 users about the boundary fluxes, their patterns, units, and sign conventions;\n",
    "3. To perform self-consistency checks to ensure the model is conserving scalar fields;\n",
    "4. To illustrate a self-contained iPython notebook of use for MOM6 analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This iPython notebook was originally developed at NOAA/GFDL, and it is provided freely to the MOM6 community. GFDL scientists developing MOM6 make extensive use of Python for diagnostics. We solicit modifications/fixes that are useful to the MOM6 community."
