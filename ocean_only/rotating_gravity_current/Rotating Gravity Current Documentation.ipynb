    "# Overview\n",
    "The rotating gravity current experiment is meant to simulate an idealized dense gravity current or overflow. A shallow continental shelf region undergoes constant in time, negative buoyancy forcing comprised of a heat flux (due to atmospheric cooling) and an evaporative flux (due to ice formation). Both are directed out of the ocean, creating dense water on the shelf. This may simulate dense shelf overflows in the Arctic, where cooling combined with ice formation in the fall and winter months creates a buildup of highly dense waters in the shallow continental shelf seas. The forcing, initial conditions, and topography of this test case may be modified to simulate Antarctic coastal polynyas or other shelf overflows around the world. The experiment is carried out for 60 days, by which point a steady state is achieved. The experiment assumes an f-plane, causing the gravity current to be influenced by rotation. The main dynamics involve:\n",
    "1. The creation of a bottom-intensified and compensating surface-intensified geostrophic jet as the dense water moves offshore along the bottom and return flow flows into the shelf near the surface. \n",
    "2. Breaking of geostrophy by bottom friction and symmetric instability in the 2D cases, development of baroclinic instability in the 3D case.\n",
    "3. Dissipation of geostrophic energy and mixing by various mechanisms including symmetric instability, eddy-driven stirring combined with viscous effects, parameterized shear mixing (Jackson shear mixing parameterization is employed), and numerical mixing in the Z\\* coordinates.\n",
    "The test case allows one to examine how different mixing parameterizations, resolutions, and coordinate systems influence representation of rotating gravity current dynamics and instability dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four simulation directories in this test case: `Layersetup_2D`, `Layersetup_3D`, `Zsetup_2D`, and `Zsetup_3D`. All cases are identical with the exception of the coordinate system (Layer coordinates in the first two and Z\\* ALE coordinates in the second two) and dimension. There is also a directory titled `Initial_Conditions` containing IPython notebooks for generating the initial conditions. There are notebooks for the 2D and 3D topography files (identical for Z\\* and Layer coordinates) titled `2D Initial conditions - topography.ipynb` and `3D Initial conditions - topography.ipynb`. Forcing is also prescribed identically in Z\\* and Layer coordinates, the notebooks for 2D and 3D are `2D Initial conditions - forcing.ipynb` and `3D Initial conditions - forcing.ipynb`. Finally, there is a notebook for generating initial temperature, salinity, and coordinate files for each case: `Initial conditions - 2D Z*.ipynb`, `Initial conditions - 2D Layer.ipynb`, `Initial conditions - 3D Z*.ipynb`, and `Initial conditions - 3D Layer.ipynb`. These notebooks are written so that a 1D NetCDF file is first read, and then the initial conditions are created from that. Alternatively, one can define all of the initial conditions analytically without reading in existing data. Within the simulation directories there are also notebooks for basic plotting of the output data, titled `Analysis -- xz fields.ipynb` or `Analysis -- xy fields.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will examine how to create initial conditions for both Z\\* and Layer coordinates (slightly more complicated in the latter), how to modify MOM_input and other runtime features, and how to handle output and restarts. \n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initial Conditions\n",
    "The initial conditions consist of: topography, forcing values, and temperature and salinity fields. For the Layer case, we must also specify density coordinates and initial layer thicknesses. The topography and forcing files are the same regardless of coordinate system, differences arise in the T and S initial conditions. All of the input files are NetCDF files that should be stored in the `INPUT/` directory within each simulation directory. To see the contents of a NetCDF file, execute `ncdump -h filename.nc`.\n",
    "### Topography\n",
    "To define the topography, we first specify the following in the MOM_input file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "TOPO_CONFIG = \"file\"             !\n",
    "TOPO_FILE = \"topog.nc\"           ! default = \"topog.nc\"\n",
    "                                 ! The file from which the bathymetry is read.\n",
    "TOPO_VARNAME = \"depth\"           ! default = \"depth\"`\n",
    "                                 ! The name of the bathymetry variable in TOPO_FILE.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use the provided IPython notebook to generate the `topog.nc` file for the 2D cases (or `topog3D.nc` file for the 3D cases). The resulting 2D `topog.nc` file should contain the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ncdump -h topog.nc\n",
    "netcdf topog {\n",

    "\t\tdepth:units = \"meters\" ;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The values of depth for this case range from 40 to 2500 meters (and are all positive). Note that even though this a 2D case (640 points in the x direction), we still have 4 points in y - this is because the minimum number of halo points (specified in MOM_input) is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forcing\n",
    "To define the buoyancy forcing, we first specify the following in the MOM_input file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "BUOY_CONFIG = \"file\"            !\n",
    "                                ! The character string that indicates how buoyancy forcing\n",
    "                                ! is specified. Valid options include (file), (zero),\n",
    "                                ! (linear), (USER), and (NONE).\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, a file containing all the forcing fields must be specified for each of the forcing fields as shown. In this case, all the fields are set to zero within the forcing file with the exception of the sensible heat flux and evaporation. Additionally, this file must contain a reference surface salinity and temperature.\n",

Keep in mind that we have negative buoyancy forcing on the shelf that creates highly dense waters that are not present in the initial conditions we used in Z\\*. Therefore, the  model coordinates should not match the initial conditions that we used in Z\\* space. It is advisable to first run the model in Z\\* coordinates, see what the final TS range is, and apply that knowledge to defining the coordinates. Otherwise, the resolution of the highly dense waters will be very poor. The header of `Coord_file.nc` should appear as:\n",

    "3. We have specified the initial temperature and salinities of the layers - now we must specify how thick each layer is (in meters). This is done in `thickness_file.nc`. Again, some layers are initially unfilled, as we have negative buoyancy forcing on the shelf that creates highly dense waters. We therefore initialize the model to have some layers that are initially infinitesimally thin. The parameter `ADJUST_THICKNESS` adjusts all the layers to take into account the topography. \n",

    "# Sponge and Tracer\n",
    "This experiment is designed to have its own packages for a passive tracer and an offshore sponge. The code for the tracer can be viewed in `MOM6-examples/src/MOM6/src/tracer/RGC_tracer.F90`. The tracer is a passive dye that tags water in the forcing region, tracing it as it propagates offshore and diluting through mixing. Values of the tracer are set to 1.0 at the surface of the forcing region at each time step, and damped to zero within the sponge boundary offshore. The sponge boundary code is located in `MOM6-examples/src/MOM6/src/user/RGC_initialization.F90`. In MOM_input, the following need to be added:\n",

    "In order to turn on the sponge, we see that we need the file `sponge_IC.nc`. This is created by running the model with the sponge turned off for one time step. The model will generate an `Initial_state.nc` file which should be renamed to `sponge_IC.nc` and placed within the `INPUT/` directory. Then, the sponge can be turned on (TRUE) and as the model runs it will damp tracers and velocities within the offshore boundary to the initial conditions. The boundary conditions in y are periodic (`REENTRANT_Y = True` in MOM_input), the sponge is only applied offshore in x. \n",

    "# Restarts and Output\n",
    "There are many additional runtime parameters that may be manipulated within MOM_input. The complete list of parameters and their defaults that may be added to MOM_input is located in MOM_parameter_doc.all. If one of the parameters from MOM_parameter_doc.all is not added to MOM_input, the default is used. Examples of parameters that may be modified at runtime include time steps, domain size, viscosity, mixing parameterization choice, boundary conditions, and length of the simulation. In this experiment we set `TIMEUNIT = 3600.0`, which defines the unit of time as one hour (3600 seconds). We then set `DAYMAX = 1440.0`, which is the length of the simulation in terms of time units. 1440.0 hours is 60 days - the length of the simulation. If we want to restart the simulation, we specify `RESTINT = 1440.0`, which will save a restart file at 1440.0 hours into the `RESTART/` directory. To restart the simulation from 60 days, we do the following:\n",
    "1. Copy the contents out of the `RESTART/` directory into the `INPUT/` directory.\n",
    "2. Save all the existing output files from the first 60 days or rename them, otherwise they will be overwritten. \n",
    "3. Edit `input.nml`, changing `input_filename = 'n'` to `input_filename = 'r'`. ('n' stands for 'new', 'r' stands for 'restart'.)\n",
    "4. To run for another 1440.0 time units (60 days), edit MOM_input to have DAYMAX = 2880.0. Run the simulation (submit `runscript2D` or `runscript3D`)\n",
    "\n",
    "To control which diagnostics are saved and at what frequency, edit the `diag_table` file. Presently, the experiment is set up to save both Z\\* or Layer coordinate output as well as remapped Z coordinate output. The former is saved into a `prog.nc` file, the latter into `prog_z.nc`. Output is saved every 6 hours, and not time averaged. The list of all the available diagnostics is in `available_diags.000000`. There are choices corresponding to `ocean_model` (native coordinate output) and `ocean_model_z` (remapped onto Z output)."
